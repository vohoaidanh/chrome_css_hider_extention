# How to Use CSS Hider Extension
CSS Hider Extension is a browser extension that allows users to automatically hide HTML elements on web pages by adding the CSS classes of those elements. This is particularly useful when you want to hide notifications, advertisements, or any unwanted elements that appear on websites.

## Steps to Use the Extension:
### Install the Extension

1. Download and install the extension in your browser (Google Chrome or Firefox).
After installation, the extension will be active immediately.
Access the Extension Settings Page

2. After installation, you can access the settings page of the extension by clicking on the extension icon in your browserâ€™s toolbar.
For Chrome users, click the extension icon in the top-right corner of your browser. For Firefox users, do the same.
Add a CSS Class to Hide Elements

3. On the settings page, you will see an input field and an "Add Class" button.
In the input field, enter the CSS class name of the element you want to hide (e.g., .popup-remind-login, .advertisement, .fixed-bottom-bar, etc.).
Click the "Add Class" button to add the class to the list.
Remove a CSS Class (if needed)

4. If you want to remove a CSS class that you previously added, simply click the "Remove" button next to the class in the list.
Automatically Hide Elements on Page Load

5. Once you have added a CSS class to the list, the extension will automatically hide elements with that CSS class every time the page is loaded.
You can add multiple CSS classes to the list to hide different elements across various websites.
Update Changes

6. If you want to update the list of CSS classes, simply add a new class or remove an old one from the settings page.
These changes will take effect immediately when you reload the page or open a new one.
### Example:
Let's say you want to hide a popup notification that appears on a website. You can find the CSS class for that popup element, for example .popup-remind-login, and add it to the list in the settings page. Then, every time you visit a page with that class, the popup will be automatically hidden.
